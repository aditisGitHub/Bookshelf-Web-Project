                    <p>Books are a powerhouse of information and knowledge. They leave a deep impact on us and are responsible for uplifting our mood. Hence, it is truly said <em><strong>books are a man's best friend</strong></em>. I am a keen reader and is always fascinated to a book shop when a pass by a road. As an adoloscent I have read many classic novels and <strong>Jane Eyre </strong> was the first unabridged book I read. Fiction novels are my all time favourite. During the Nation-wide lockdown due to the outbreak of Covid-19, I have read a few self-help books like <strong>The 5AM Club</strong>, <strong>Tuesdays with Morrie</strong>, and some more. All these books have inspired me to the core and taught me some of the best life lessons like, following a good morning routine being one of them. </p>
